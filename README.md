  ## [SCPStatusBot merging with SCPToolsBot](https://github.com/Vxrpenter/SCPToolsBot)
  <h6>This project will be archived and then merged with SCPToolsBot during it's kotlin refactor. All features from this project will be brought over and perfected to a new feature to mutlihost server bots, that sync with cedmod/the server directly.</h6>

</div>

<h2>Why should I use to SCPToolsBot</h3>

> It provides many features like automatic time role syncing, a custom support system, fully customizable configuration and more. It can be easily set up on all operating systems if it has `jdk-22` or higher for the refactor and `jdk-23` for older versions beginning at `0.3.0`
